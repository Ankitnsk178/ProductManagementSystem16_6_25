You are building a Product Inventory Management System for a retail store. The store needs a system where staff can:

create Category entity which will map to product (One to Many)

Add, update, delete, and view products.

Add, update, delete and view Category

Search for products:

Within a specific price range

By product name (exact or partial match)

Get the top 5 cheapest products

Get Product by Category also

The business wants this to be scalable and type-safe, so use Hibernate Criteria API for filtering.
